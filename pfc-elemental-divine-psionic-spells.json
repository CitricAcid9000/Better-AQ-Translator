        "Description": "Rateburner IIThe affected area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the area, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. The Anti-Magic Zone does not move with the caster.Spells and other magical effects, except those created by a deity or their artifacts, are suppressed in the zone and can't protrude into it. Units or charges expended to cast a suppressed spell are consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.Targeted Effects: Spells and other magical effects, such as Minibolt, that target a creature or an object in the zone have no effect on that target.Areas of Magic: The area of another spell or magical effect, such as Fireball, can't extend into the area. If the Anti-Magic Zone overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the zone is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a Flame Barrier are suppressed within the zone, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.Spells: Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the zone is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.Magic Items: The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the zone. For example, a +1 Long Sword in the Sphere functions as a nonmagical Long Sword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the zone or wielded by an attacker in the zone. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the zone (For example, if someone fires a +1 bullet or throws a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.Magical Travel: Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the zone, whether the zone is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space, temporarily closes while in the zone.Creatures and Objects: A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the zone. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the zone.Revocation Magic: Spells and magical effects such as Revocation have no effect on the zone. Likewise, the spheres created by different Anti-Magic Area spells don't nullify each other.",
